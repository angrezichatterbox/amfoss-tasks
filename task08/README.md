# Poke-Search 🕵️‍♂️🔍📱

## Project Overview

This project was an exciting adventure that took approximately 3-4 days to complete. Throughout the process, I learned a lot and gained valuable skills. Here's a breakdown of the journey:

## 1. Learning the Basics

At the outset, I had to acquaint myself with the fundamentals of working with APIs. Understanding how to fetch data from an API was crucial for the success of this project.

## 2. Exploring PySide

I also delved into the world of PySide, a Python library that enables the creation of graphical user interfaces. I needed to grasp its core concepts and components to build the user interface for my Poke-Search app.

## 3. Building the Interface

As I progressed, I realized that PySide was instrumental in creating the user-friendly interface of my Poke-Search app.

## 4. Search Feature

One of the core features of the app was the search button. When users hit that button, I ensured that detailed Pokémon information was displayed.

## 5. Expanding Functionality

Over time, I didn't stop at just the search feature. I gradually added more buttons and features, such as capturing Pokémon and other exciting elements.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was an incredible learning experience. I not only discovered how to design a user-friendly interface in Python but also mastered the art of fetching data from an API and presenting it on the screen.

It's safe to say that my journey with Poke-Search was both educational and fun! 🤓🎉 #PokémonMastery
