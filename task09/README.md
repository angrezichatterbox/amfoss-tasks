# Geo-Quest 🌍📍🗺️

This task took me around a week to complete, and even though I'm still not well-versed in the Flutter language, I found myself gradually getting the hang of it. 🕒💻 I faced the challenge of understanding Flutter code, but with persistence, I began to grasp it more easily.

The main objective of this task was to drop a pin on a map, calculate the time and distance, and draw a line along the path. 📍🗺️✏️ The initial step involved integrating an OpenStreetMap URL and creating a basic map with limited functionality, which was relatively straightforward.

The real challenges arose when I attempted to add a marker. I initially struggled with understanding layers and where to insert the code, but through research and learning, I now have a better grasp of how different elements work in Flutter. 🤓📚

Calculating distance and time involved using the Haversine formula and considering the concept of average speed. 🧮⏱️ The trickiest part for me was implementing the route, as most resources online were focused on Google Maps API, which required payment. After extensive searching, I discovered OpenRoute, which helped me incorporate a route between two locations: the current location and the selected pointer location. 🚗🗺️

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience, and I'm proud of the progress I've made in Flutter development. 🌟🚀
