# Hello World Task 

During this task, the main objective was to create a program that takes in a number 'n' and lists prime numbers up to 'n' . To accomplish this task, I developed an algorithm that runs a loop . It divides numbers from 1 to 'n' by numbers from 1 to 'n' to determine if the remainder is 0. If the remainder is not 0 for all the numbers, it is considered a prime number .

I first implemented this task in Python , leveraging my previous experience with the language. For other programming languages, I referred to the language documentation  to replicate the basic concepts used in my Python code.

However, I encountered some challenges during this project :
- I faced difficulties while writing code for certain languages, such as Elixir, and had to overcome various obstacles.
