# Hello World Task 🌍

The main objective during the task was to create a program that takes in a number 'n' and lists prime numbers till 'n' 🌟. For doing this task, I first developed an algorithm that runs a loop 🔄. It divides numbers from 1 to 'n' by numbers from 1 to 'n' to find if the remainder is 0. If the remainder is not 0 for all the numbers, it would return as a prime number 🔢🔍.

The task was easily accomplished by me first in Python 🐍, as I had previous experience in Python 🐍. For the other languages, I referred to the documentation 📚 of the language to replicate the basic concepts I used in my Python code.

However, I encountered some blockers during this project 😓:
--> I wasn't able to easily write the code in Rust, Haskell, and Elixir, as I couldn't easily find resources for those tasks 📚🤔. Also, some Python code concepts were difficult to implement into the code of those languages 🤯.
