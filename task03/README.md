# Hello World Task 🌍

During this task, the main objective was to create a program that takes in a number 'n' and lists prime numbers up to 'n' 🌟. To accomplish this task, I developed an algorithm that runs a loop 🔄. It divides numbers from 1 to 'n' by numbers from 1 to 'n' to determine if the remainder is 0. If the remainder is not 0 for all the numbers, it is considered a prime number 🔢🔍.

I first implemented this task in Python 🐍, leveraging my previous experience with the language. For other programming languages, I referred to the language documentation 📚 to replicate the basic concepts used in my Python code.

However, I encountered some challenges during this project 😓:
- I faced difficulties while writing code for certain languages, such as Elixir, and had to overcome various obstacles.
