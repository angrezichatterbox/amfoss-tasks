# Ubuntu Installation 💻
🎉🐧 Successfully installed Ubuntu using a Virtual Machine named UTM on my macOS system! 🖥️ Didn't go for dual boot since I didn't really need Ubuntu, considering macOS already has a powerful Linux terminal. 💻🍏 Super smooth installation process!

Some Blockers I faced:
--> The VM available online were more for Windows and the one more famously avaiable for mac parallels Desktop was paid . Continuing my quest i found UTM which i installed for doing some initial tasks

Later i installed Dual Boot on Mac Since i felt like i might need it for varioususes The overall Experiance of doing it was quite intresting since by default or ethically Mac doesnot so i had to find git pages where people had put up soltuions for doing so
