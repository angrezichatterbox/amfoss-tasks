# Ubuntu Installation 💻
🎉🐧 Successfully installed Ubuntu using a Virtual Machine named UTM on my macOS system! 🖥️ Didn't go for dual boot since I didn't really need Ubuntu, considering macOS already has a powerful Linux terminal. 💻🍏 Super smooth installation process!

Some Blockers I faced:
--> The VM available online were more for Windows and the one more famously avaiable for mac parallels Desktop was paid . Continuing my quest i found UTM which i installed for doing some initial tasks
