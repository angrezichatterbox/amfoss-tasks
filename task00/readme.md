# Ubuntu Installation 💻

🎉🐧 I successfully installed Ubuntu on my macOS system using a Virtual Machine named UTM! 🖥️ I opted not to set up dual boot since I didn't really need Ubuntu, given that macOS already comes equipped with a powerful Linux terminal. 💻🍏 The installation process was super smooth!

## Challenges Faced:

- Availability of VMs: Most virtual machines available online were tailored for Windows. Additionally, the more famous option for Mac, Parallels Desktop, was a paid solution. Undeterred, I continued my quest.

- Discovery of UTM: After some research, I stumbled upon UTM and decided to install it for my initial tasks.

- Later, I installed Dual Boot on Mac because I felt I might need it for various purposes. The overall experience was quite interesting because by default, macOS doesn't support this. I had to search for Git pages where people had posted solutions for achieving it.

Overall, the journey of installing and configuring Ubuntu on my macOS system has been both educational and rewarding. 💻🍏🐧
