🏏 Crickey: Your Ultimate Cricket Discord Bot 🏏

My main task during the creation of this bot is to develop it and showcase my skills to HariGovind. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. Initially, I attempted web scraping using BeautifulSoup, and I learned how to do this by following the documentation provided. I started by gathering all the necessary data and then progressed to learning how to index and extract specific data. 🌐📈

I also familiarized myself with basic request handling when extracting data from a website. I learned that a "200" status code indicates that the website data was successfully retrieved. After completing the web scraping part, I shifted my focus to creating a basic Discord bot. To achieve this, I first had to generate a token and set some basic permissions. Subsequently, I learned how to implement various commands and extract data from another Python file, which was then integrated into my bot.py file containing the Discord program. 🤖🔑

I encountered a couple of blockers during the project:

I initially struggled with integrating the code from one part of the project into another.
I faced issues with the built-in !help command, as I was unaware that it was already defined. ❗
In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to improving my skills further.
