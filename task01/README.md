# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® Terminal Wizard's 
This Harry Potter theme task was a lot of fun . Even though i didnot watch harry Potter earlier The task was fun to complete After 
googlging a lot i got to know how awesome the harry potter world is. The task was more like detectice type where i get to solve the 
task by doing some sort of clues. The first 3 tasks were super easy Even though i had some trouble in finding the branch .. It got solved
pretty easily. the task that really i took time was task4 where i had to sit some while infront of the laptop to really get my head working since i felt the clue quite tough to actually answer easily.
One of the major problems i had later on after solving was pushing this into github which i didnt know how to do using terminal so initially i uploaded it later on i got to know that we must first initialize the folder by uisng git init then only we can upload the file uisng terminal
