# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® Terminal Wizard's

This Harry Potter theme task was a lot of fun, even though I did not watch Harry Potter earlier. The task was fun to complete after googling a lot, and I got to know how awesome the Harry Potter world is. The task was more like a detective type, where I got to solve the task by following some sort of clues. The first 3 tasks were super easy, even though I had some trouble finding the branch, but it got solved pretty easily. The task that really took me some time was task 4, where I had to sit in front of the laptop for a while to get my head working, as I felt the clue was quite tough to answer easily.

One of the major problems I had later on, after solving, was pushing this into GitHub, which I didn't know how to do using the terminal. Initially, I uploaded it, but later on, I got to know that we must first initialize the folder using git init, and then only we can upload the file using the terminal.
