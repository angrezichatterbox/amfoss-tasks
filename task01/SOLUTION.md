# How did I do the tasks ??
Before the begining of the first task the git commands used by me include git clone for cloning the directory containing TerminalWizard.
for cloning the statement used by me was git clone <link>
The entire activity was done by me in Ubuntu.After that I connected my terminal and GitHub account by first installed gh using the command
sudo apt install gh
Then i logged into my account using the command git auth login
## The First Challenge
For the first task much of git commands werent required rather basic solution for logical questions were required for finding the name
of the file
## The Second Challenge
I had't required to use much of git terminal commands
## The Third Challenge
Before the begining of the third challenge i had to change my branch according to the clue give to me "you'd have to switch to a branch, which is named after the subject taught by Professor Lupin at Hogwarts." after googling the subject i got the subject as defenseagainstthedarkarts but i didnt know the exact branch name for this i had to ask my mentor through which i got to know to find the name of the various branches git-a is the command i used through it i found the name of the branch is defenseAgainstTheDarkArts then i transfered to the spell book by using the command git checkout defenseAgainstTheDarkArts spellbook
## The Fourth Challenge
After reading the text given under the fourth challenge i got to know that the branchname must be thegraveyard to know the exact way of typing the branch name i used the git - a command through which i got to know the branch name is thegraveyard then i used git checkout thegraveyard spellbook and accordingly found my file 
## The End
During the search of the file name i had some diffculity so i had to use some trial and error since i wasn't a harry potter fan earlier and i found the code was aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs
on using the base64 converter i got to know the code converts to https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell 
On seaching the link on google i got a final spell and a task to do
