# How I Tackled the Tasks 🧙‍♂️

Before diving into the first task, I began by using the Git commands to set up my environment. I initiated the process by cloning the directory containing TerminalWizard using the following command:

#### git clone <link>

The entire magical journey unfolded in the enchanting realm of Ubuntu. 🪄✨

Once I had the necessary repository, I needed to connect my terminal to my GitHub account. To accomplish this, I started by installing the GitHub CLI (gh) with the following command:

#### sudo apt install gh

With the GitHub CLI in place, I proceeded to log into my GitHub account. 🪄🌟 I used the following command to initiate the authentication process:

#### gh auth login

This allowed me to seamlessly access the GitHub powers I needed to tackle the tasks ahead. 🚀🔮✨

## The First Challenge 🧙‍♂️

For the inaugural task, the mystical realm of Git was not required. Instead, I delved into the world of logic and riddles to uncover the elusive file name. 📜🕵️

## The Second Challenge 🧙‍♂️

The second challenge also spared me from delving too deeply into Git's arcane commands. 🪄✨

## The Third Challenge 🧙‍♂️

In the third challenge, I faced the need to switch branches in alignment with the given clue: "you'd have to switch to a branch, which is named after the subject taught by Professor Lupin at Hogwarts." 🧙‍♀️📚 After a little research, I uncovered that the subject in question was "Defense Against the Dark Arts." However, the exact branch name eluded me. Seeking guidance from my mentor, I discovered the path forward: the command git-a led me to the branch named defenseAgainstTheDarkArts. With a flick of my digital wand, I switched to this branch using the incantation:

#### git checkout defenseAgainstTheDarkArts spellbook

## The Fourth Challenge 🧙‍♂️

In the fourth challenge, I unearthed a branch named "thegraveyard" 🪦 using the git-a command. I then conjured the spell to transport myself to this branch:

#### git checkout thegraveyard spellbook

## The End 🧙‍♂️
 
During my quest to find the elusive file name, I encountered some difficulties. As I wasn't well-versed in the lore of Harry Potter, I resorted to trial and error. Ultimately, I uncovered a mysterious code: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs. A touch of magic, in the form of a base64 converter, revealed its true nature: https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell. A search through the digital ether led me to the final spell and one last task to complete. 🌟🪄🔮
