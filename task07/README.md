This task initially felt tough, 😅 but as time went by, I could easily find resources for making the extensions on YouTube. By doing this task, I could take in knowledge of t`he CSS I learned while doing the hypertext mockup language task. 😊 I also learned to integrate JavaScript code along with it. 🚀 I also learned how to implement these codes together. 🤝 I learned how to upload an extension to Google Chrome. 🌐 During the course of this project, I learned how to use an API to give us live updates on the console. 📈 I also made the extension take in my live location. 🌍"
