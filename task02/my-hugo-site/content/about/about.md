Hello there! 👋 I'm Gautham Mohanraj, and I hail from the charming town of Mahe. Now, Mahe might raise a few eyebrows—it's nestled within Puducherry, which primarily speaks Tamil, yet here I am in Kerala's embrace. 🌴🌊

I learned to code in ninth grade.Back then, coding was just a cool trick to impress my pals. Little did I know, that initial spark would kindle an enduring passion. 🖥️💡

Though my early projects might not have turned heads, each line of code I wrote carried a piece of my enthusiasm. ⌨️🚀

So, whether it's unraveling intricate algorithms or bringing ingenious ideas to life, I'm here, fueled by the thrill of coding and the joy it brings to my journey. And hey, the best part? The story is just getting started. 🌈🚀
