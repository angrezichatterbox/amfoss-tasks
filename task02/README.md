# Lessgo Hugo 

The task was quite interesting to do since I learned how to do basic web building using Hugo, which I had not heard of before. The only blocker I faced during this task was uploading it through GitHub Pages; I couldn't do it properly since it always showed some sort of error. A few days before completing the task, I came across an article that explained how to upload it without using a workflow file in the folder and directly using the public folder. 🌐
