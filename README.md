## Introduction

üëã Hello, I'm Gautham Mohanraj, and I'm excited to introduce myself and share my vision for contributing to our esteemed Amrita FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) club. üöÄ I may not have as much experience as some other members, but I'm eager to learn, grow, and make a positive impact as part of this community.

## Why Choose Me? ü§î

I have an inherent curiosity and a strong desire to learn new things. I find joy in tackling challenges and exploring new horizons. While I may not be the most knowledgeable, I am committed to learning and giving my best to the club.

My passion for open source and free software is unwavering. üí° I see the potential for open source contributions to make a difference, and I'm eager to collaborate and contribute to this transformative movement.

I have a knack for identifying areas where software can be improved or new features added. While I may not always know how to implement them, I'm keen to explore and learn, and I believe this mindset can be valuable.

Collaboration is something I value deeply. I thrive in team environments and look forward to working closely with fellow members to enhance open source projects and promote the FOSS philosophy. ü§ù

## Goals for the Next Six Months üìÜ

Over the next six months, I've set some achievable goals considering my current knowledge and skills:

**Goal 1**: I aspire to gain expertise in a specific domain. While I may not be there yet, I'm eager to focus my efforts on one domain that truly interests me and become proficient in it.

**How**: I've shortlisted several domains I'm passionate about and plan to immerse myself in them, learning from experienced members and contributing where I can.

**Goal 2**: I'd love to make meaningful contributions to open source projects and aim for participation in programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

**How**: I'm looking forward to learning from senior members about the intricacies of open source contributions and what it takes to succeed in programs like GSoC.

## Contribution to the Club ü§ù

I may be the small guy who knows a little less than others, but I'm committed to making a positive impact within the FOSS club:

**Participation**: I'll actively attend club meetings, events, and activities, even if I'm not the most knowledgeable member. My presence and enthusiasm will be my contribution.

**Sharing Knowledge**: As I learn and grow, I'll proactively share my insights with fellow members, and together, we can foster an environment of mutual growth.

**Initiative**: While I may not lead projects right away, I'll be on the lookout for opportunities to propose ideas and contribute to projects that align with our club's mission.

**Support**: I'm here to support club leaders and members in any way I can. Whether it's organizing events or helping with tasks, count on me to contribute to our club's success.

## Thoughts on the Praveshan Process ü§î

The tasks for the praveshan to the club were indeed challenging, and I appreciate the opportunity to learn and grow through them. However, I would like to share some feedback on the process:

The tasks were a bit challenging, and I faced difficulties, but I understand the reasons behind their complexity. Given more time, I believe I could have delved deeper into some of the tasks. Currently, I have a basic understanding of different domains, but I couldn't explore them thoroughly. The time constraint was a limiting factor in this regard, and having a bit more time for learning and exploration would have been beneficial.

Despite the challenges, I see the value in pushing ourselves to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue this journey of improvement within the FOSS club.

I'm excited about the prospect of being a part of this FOSS club and growing alongside all of you. Let's embrace the journey of learning and contributing together! üåüüöÄ
