## 🤔 Why Pick Me? 🚀

I started coding in 9th grade, and I fell in love with it. 🖥️ I code not just for fun but because I'm passionate about it. 🌟 I've worked on many school projects, and while they might not be super fancy, they represent my journey of falling in love with coding. 🧩

So, why should you choose me? 🤷‍♂️ Because I'm super passionate about coding and want to contribute to open source projects. 🌐 I'm not just coding; I'm coding with a purpose, and I'm excited to make a positive impact. 🤝 I'm here to learn, even from my mistakes. 📚💡

My commitment to learning, my problem-solving skills, and my willingness to make a difference make me a great fit for open source projects. 🌐 I'm here to code with purpose and have fun doing it. 🚀

## What I Want to Achieve in 6 Months 🌟

In the next 6 months, I have a few clear goals. First, I want to improve my coding skills by tackling challenging problems. I want to level up my problem-solving game.

I'm also excited about Flutter, a cool tool for making mobile apps. I want to master it and create awesome mobile apps.

Lastly, web development has me hooked. I want to dive deep into this world, understand it inside out, and become a web development whiz.

In short, my goals for the next 6 months are to boost my coding skills, become a Flutter pro, and rock the world of web development. I'm all about continuous growth and staying at the cutting edge of technology. 🚀

## How I'll Contribute to the Club 🤝

I'm eager to contribute wherever I can in the club. I'm ready to jump in and help out with any opportunities that come my way.

## Thoughts on the Praveshan Process 🤔

The tasks for joining the club were tough, but I learned a lot. However, I have some feedback:

The tasks were a bit challenging, and I faced difficulties, but I understand why they were complex. With more time, I could have explored them further. Right now, I have a basic understanding of different areas, but I couldn't go deep into them due to time constraints. Having more time for learning and exploring would have been helpful.
