# Hypertext Mockup Language 
This was a pretty fun task to do.  I spent around 2-3 days on this task initially, going learning the basics of HTML . Then I learned about CSS . I earlier didn't exactly know the difference in use between CSS and HTML . After working on this task, I got to know HTML is used to define the webpage 🌐, and CSS is for the designs . By working on this project, I got to know how to implement HTML and CSS code together . Also, I got to know how to make a nav bar  and how to add hyperlinks to other websites . Overall, I also googled a lot during the making of this site for various causes , since I didn't exactly know CSS or HTML to a higher level .

Some Blockers I faced during this project :
--> I was not able to get the correct allignment of the background image for this i had to learn how to use Css to properly align the entire background image properly without it being naturally zoomed

--> While making the the items page i wasnt able to propelry align the entire table Even though its still not completeley aligned i felt it was much better than before since earlier the items got hidden.

What did i learn :
--> I learned Basic CSS!!
--> I learned Basic Html

--> I learned how to integrate CSS code and HTML Code For the first time.
