# Hypertext Mockup Language 📄💻
This was a pretty fun task to do. 😄 I spent around 2-3 days on this task initially, going learning the basics of HTML 📚🖥️. Then I learned about CSS 🎨. I earlier didn't exactly know the difference in use between CSS and HTML 🤔. After working on this task, I got to know HTML is used to define the webpage 🌐, and CSS is for the designs 🎨. By working on this project, I got to know how to implement HTML and CSS code together 👨‍💻👩‍💻. Also, I got to know how to make a nav bar 📌 and how to add hyperlinks to other websites 🌐🔗. Overall, I also googled a lot during the making of this site for various causes 🧐🔍, since I didn't exactly know CSS or HTML to a higher level 📖🌟.

Some Blockers I faced during this project :
--> I was not able to get the correct allignment of the background image for this i had to learn how to use Css to properly align the entire background image properly without it being naturally zoomed
--> While making the the items page i wasnt able to propelry align the entire table Even though its still not completeley aligned i felt it was much better than before since earlier the items got hidden.

What did i learn :
--> I learned Basic CSS 

--> I learned Basic Html

--> I learned how to integrate CSS code and HTML Code For the first time.
