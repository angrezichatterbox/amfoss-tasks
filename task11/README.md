# TinkerCad 

Creating the circuit for this project wasn't too challenging for me, as I had previously learned how to connect basic Arduino projects back in my 9th-grade school class. The experience I gained from those earlier lessons proved to be quite useful.

When it came to coding, I was able to complete it with the assistance of similar projects I found on YouTube. üñ•Ô∏èüìö This collaborative learning approach helped me understand and implement the necessary code for the project.

Overall, this task was a valuable opportunity for me to revisit and apply my Arduino knowledge. It allowed me to create a basic project in Tinkercad, further enhancing my skills in electronics and programming.
