# 📜✍️ Vim 🪄✨
This task was quite easily completed but seemed to be the most helpful task since usually in vs code i had faced an issue where i wasnt able 
type anything usually i used to slam by keyboard here and there and then i could type after learning vim i got to know that we must type just
A to type when such issues occur.
